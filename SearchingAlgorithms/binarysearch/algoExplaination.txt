BINARY SEARCH:
Binary Search is the fastest and effecient algoritm to find an item from a SORTED array.

We will be given a sorted array arr[] of n size,we have to write a function to search a given element x in arr[].

STEPS:
 1. In this we search a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half everytime.
 2. Our first interval will cover the whole array starting from index=0 and ending at index=arr.length-1. 
 3. If the value of element to be found(X) is less than the item at the middle of the interval, narrow the interval to the lower half. 
 4. Otherwise narrow it to the upper half. 
 5. Repeatedly check until the value is found.
 6. If value is found return its index else return -1 if not found.

 TIME COMPLEXITY:
 O(log n)  with base 2 
 On an average the binary search algorithm needs log2 n iterations for a list of length n as it reduces the area to be searched to half everytime.


 SPACE COMPLEXITY:
 (O(1))
 Binary search takes constant space i.e. the space taken by the algorithm is the same for any number of elements in the array.
