# Hacktoberfest2020

A collection of different types of algorithms used for various different Data Structures, in different languages.
This repository is open to all. 
To help you out with your Hacktoberfest goals!!  
All you need to do is just add any algorithm of your choice in any language you like with only the condition that it hasn't already been added.


## Structure of the Repository

- The Repository contains folders with names of Data Structures the Algorithms are based on, or the Name of the Algorithms if its valid for multiple data Structures.
- Inside each folder there maybe subfolders for the specific Algorithms.
- Each Algorithm folder contains        

 1.  A Text file or an MD file which contains the Theory/ Explanation of the Algorithm
 2. and Several other files containing the code for the same, for different languages.   
These files MUST BE NAMED in the format Algorithm Name - language. ( Eg: Binary Search - C++ )  

Example:   
Trees -> Inorder Traversal -> InorderTraversal- C++, Inorder Traversal-Python   
Graphs -> Bellman Ford -> Bellman Ford-C++, BellmanFord-Java,....


## What can you contribute ?

You can either add
- The theory/explainations of the Algorithms   
 ( Discuss the approach, Time and Space Complexities, Examples, etc. )   
 (Please add references as well, if used)  

- Code for the Algorithm in a language of your choice.


## Guidelines

- Go Inside the Data Structure or Algorithm folder (if already created, else create one).
- Go inside the  folder with the specific Algorithm Name. If not present then create a new folder with the name of the algorithm and add your files in it.
- Create a .txt file with the Algorithm Theory/Explanation or a solution file which contains the code for the Algorithm, named acc to the language used to implement it. ( Eg: Inorder Traversal-C++ )
- Add this file inside the folder with the name of the algorithm you have implemented.
- If you have some specific details u need to add according to the implementation in a specific language, add it as comments in the code, or create a sub-folder (Algo Name - language) and add the text file and the code files.  
(Can also be done in case the implementation in a language requires more than one file.)
- A more organized and structured pull request has greater chances to be approved.

## Note

- Avoid overwriting other people's contributions, adding spaces and tabs or making any other type of invalid pull requests.   
 (They will be marked invalid and won't be counted in your HacktoberFest goals.) ( PS- If you find any such requests, please report to us.)
- If you have any other doubts, feel free to discuss in the issue.

Idea for some algorithms  :

- Searching Algorithms
- Sorting Algorithms
- Graph Algos ( Bellman Ford ,Topological sort, BFS,DFS,Dijkstra, Min spanning tree algos) 
- Tree Algos 
- Stacks ( inorder and post order expressions)
